PUT:
The file existence is verified, if it doesn't exist skip to the next loop.

The client sends a message contaning ("tput", FILENAME, <SIZE>),
\\a \n is appended to the filename to act as a sentintal btwn it in and size

The Server moves in to a recv mode, and will read for the number of bytes in <SIZE>

The client sends a file using the sendfile(sockfd, filename) method

The server sends back an acknolwedgment that it wrote the file.

GET:

The client sends a message contaning ("TGET", FILENAME)

The server verfies if the file exists, and sends a response(SIZE).

	if it gets the response and it's negative continue
else:
	if it gets a response and it's positive the client will wait on a recv until it gets bytes equal to size,
		if size ==0 it just writes a file of that name to the drive, b/c there's nothing to send.

Tconnect:

The client sends a connect message out to the server, 
if it doesn't find anything on the given server and port it errors out and closes the program

Tlist:
The client sends a message ("tlist")

The server performs an os.list(), stores the results in a variable and sends that over

if there was a failure it sends back negative value, and the client prints an error.

Tchdir
The client sends a message ("Tchdir")

The server performs an os.chdr(), sends a message ack that the action has been performed

if there was a failure it sends back negative value, and the client prints an error.


Clien side TPUT steps:
- When the user asks to send a file it looks for the file in the immediate folder
- it then gets the size of that file
- it then closes the file
- Client sends a message to the server tellling it to got to the tput command, and that it well have a size of <size>
- it then uses the send_file() method, not sendfile() method, 
- the send_file sends only 1024 bytes at a time
