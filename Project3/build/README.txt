This folder contains the skeleton program for the TigerC. Use the existing 
main_c or main_cpp by converting the filename to main.c or main.cpp, 
respectively. Chose one based on your language of choice (C vs. C++). 

The Makefile is already configured to build your project for you regardless 
of using C or C++.  If you have to add more file, add them to the src/client 
folder to avoid confusion with the src/library code.

This folder structure may be copied and reused for the TigerS build environment
as well. Simply delete all C, C++, and header files. There is no pre-made 
library for you to use for the TigerS portion of the project.  Therefore, all 
code can go into the src/server folder and header files go in the include 
directory.

This code was designed and built for both Debian Linux and MacOSX. It should 
port to Unix. Avoid the use of MS Visual Studios. I will not be chasing MSVS
install environments for students.

Note that the lexer.cpp is autogenerated by the re2c application. If you 
plan to mod°ÛvÆÿify the lexer in any way:

  1. Make sure you document what you did and why in your documentation
  2. Follow the instructions in the src/library/readme.txt
